# ðŸš€ How to Run Hexa Paint Animation

## Quick Start (Recommended)

### Option 1: Run the Setup Script (Easiest)
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd hexa-paint-animation

# Run the automated setup script
python setup_and_run.py
```

### Option 2: Use Batch File (Windows)
```bash
# Double-click or run in command prompt
setup_and_run.bat
```

### Option 3: Use PowerShell Script (Windows)
```powershell
# Run in PowerShell
.\setup_and_run.ps1
```

## Manual Setup (Step by Step)

### 1. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
# Try Python 3.10 first
py -3.10 -m venv venv

# If Python 3.10 not available, use default
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

### 5. Open in Browser
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`

## What the Setup Script Does

1. âœ… Removes any existing virtual environment
2. âœ… Creates new virtual environment with Python 3.10 (or default)
3. âœ… Upgrades pip to latest version
4. âœ… Installs all required dependencies
5. âœ… Tests that core dependencies work
6. âœ… Starts the web application
7. âœ… Opens browser to http://localhost:5000

## Troubleshooting

### If Python 3.10 is not found:
- Download Python 3.10.18 from: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31018/
- Or the script will automatically use your default Python version

### If packages fail to install:
- Make sure you have internet connection
- Try running: `pip install --upgrade pip` first
- Some packages may take time to download

### If the application doesn't start:
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Make sure port 5000 is not in use
- Try running: `python main.py` manually
